            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as I have from my Youth been trained up in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Diſcipline, ſo it has been the goodneſs of God to me to incline my Mind to ſeek after him, and that with a Deſire after Knowledge, leſt my Zeal ſhould only proceed from Ignorance.</p>
            <p>And it still remaining in my Memory, That when I was ſcarce ſeven Years old, my Mother (being Religious) uſed to take me aſide to pay to God with her upon my Knees; but ſoon after ſhe turned to the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and then I heard no more of that kind of Exerciſe,</p>

            <p>For the Conſciences of my old Friends are my Record this day, That mary in their Church have been ill Perſons, who at the ſame time have not wanted heat of Zeal for the Form, and for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Friends; and ſo far my Experience agrees with <hi>W.

               </gap>, That many times ſingle Perſons have been in the right, when gathered Churches and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations have been wrong; Examples of this we have in all Ages.</p>
            <p>But paſſing on to the Year <hi>1691.</hi> when Differences aroſe at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> between <hi>George Keith</hi> and others, from his being accuſed to preach <hi>Two Chriſts,</hi> becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I began to find a Call within me, To be active in the ſtation and Capacity wherein God had put me. Wherefore I ſet a Reſolution to Search and Try things for my ſelf, and not to believe on truſt, or becauſe others did. Well, accordingly I ſearcht our Friends Books, to ſee if thoſe various Reports were true or falſe; and having, by diligence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Satiſfaction therein, I could not find eaſe in

            <p>Now an <hi>Objection</hi> falls in my way, which I have heard my Old Fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And it was worthily obſerved of <hi>Calvin</hi> (as cited in one of their own Books, entituled, <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgment,</hi> p. <hi>128.</hi>) viz. <hi>That</hi> Calvin <hi>inclined to the Divinity of the Light in men

univerſally, but a little ſhy of ſpeaking more poſitively, for fear of abuſe by Phanaticks.</hi> Behold! now this great Reformer had a perfect ſence how men might run into Abuſes, by high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Light and Spirituality. And whether what that great Reformer feared in that Age, be not come to paſs now in this Age, I leave to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Impartial <hi>Reader</hi> of the enſuing Book.</p>

               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We have account from <hi>England,</hi> That ſince <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s arrival there, the Doctrine of Chriſt crucified, and faith in him, as without men, is now frequently preached by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> cauſing many to ſay, <hi>That if ever Chriſt was preached out of Envy, now is the time</hi> (as we read ſome did in the Apostles days) hence 'tis not impoſſible, but in time they may come to preach that Doctrine in true love, and ſo confeſs that <hi>George Keith</hi> has been the greateſt Instrument in Gods hand, of good to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that ever yet aroſe amongst them.</p>
            <p>But by the Complaint that their Friend A. <hi>Hulins</hi> lately made to their Mens Meeting at <hi>Burlington,</hi> by a Paper given in under his hand, it appears, that the Preachers about <hi>Delaware</hi> are not yet come ſo far as to preach ſuch Doctrine out of Envy; much leſs for love.

            <p>Now, who would think any other, but that this <hi>Quakers</hi> Church at <hi>Burlington</hi> ſhould condemn ſuch Doctrine as this? No, but this they did not do, but gave <hi>A.

               </q> Of this falſe Doctrine <hi>G.

               </p>
               <p>E. B cites <hi>J. Bunions</hi> Principles, p. 304, 306. <hi>Now I come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to reckon up</hi> John Bunions <hi>damnable Doctrines and Errors,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, <hi>John Bunyon</hi> ſaid, <hi>That Chriſts ſecond coming was not his coming in the Spirit, for his coming in the Spirit is no Coming.</hi>

               <p>For this, ſee at <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. where G. W. owns the two comings of Chriſt, one that is already paſt, &amp; another to come at the end of the world or laſt Day.

               </p>
               <p>For this ſee at <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. where <hi>Jo. Coal</hi> holds the Church to be the Body of Chriſt, &amp; this Body G. F. (in <hi>Gr.

               </p>
               <p>Next, ſee <hi>Qrs. plainneſs,</hi> by G. W. p. 37, 38. Muggelton <hi>holds theſe falſe &amp; blaſphemous Doctrines</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the</hi> Quakers <hi>utterly deny,</hi> viz.</p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:63933:32"/>For this, ſee at <hi>Numb.</hi> 37, 38, 39. where they deny the Body to be Chriſt, &amp; that it was Chriſt that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>od, yea, they declare, <hi>That Christ in that Body dyed,</hi> or was crucified. And <hi>that both Soul and Body was ſacrificed,</hi> ſee Numb. 42</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now, ſee above whether they do not hold the ſame; for at <hi>Numb</hi> 39, 11, G. W. ſays, <hi>It was Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3dly, That <hi>Muggleton</hi> holds, <hi>That Christ being God, imbodied with fleſh and bone, one Perſon without us, cannot be in the</hi> Quakers.</p>
               <p>For this, ſee at <hi>Numb.</hi> 35, 36, 12. where they hold, <hi>Christ remains a Man, conſiſting of Spirit, Soul and Body, the ſame Body that dyed; and that the Body of Chriſt is not ſo much as in any one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4thly, That <hi>Muggleton</hi> holds, <hi>That God was born of</hi> Mary.</p>
               <p>For this, ſee at <hi>Numb.</hi> 33, 51. where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, Chriſt to be true God born of <hi>Mary;</hi> alſo, That God the Father took humane or Mans Nature.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly, That <hi>Muggleton</hi> holds, <hi>That the Devil became Fleſh, Blood and Bone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this, ſee the Preface to G. W<hi>'s Judgment fixt,</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:63933:32"/>
where he ſays of ſome ſeperate <hi>Quakers That they are Devils incarnate, viz.</hi> made fleſh or become Man, which is fleſh, blood and bone. Le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus it appears how far their Doctrine agrees with what G. W. calls <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now ſays W. P. (<hi>Rejoynder,</hi> p. 38) <hi>I cannot but obſerve at what a ſuſpected rate the Scriptures have been both firſt collected, and then convered through the ſeveral ſucceeding Ages—I may well object, Are we ſure the Judgment of them who firſt collected them was ſufficient to determine what was right, and what not?</hi>—(Alſo <hi>How ſhall we be aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now therefore ſince W. P. thus declares the Uncertainty of the Scriptures of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Pſalmiſt (to which the Apoſtle ſeems to refer) ſhews that Text to be altered, why then ſhould he and his Brethren build ſuch monſtrous Principles upon ſo uncertain a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they render it? That upon theſe words,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63933:43"/>
(which it ſeems are properly) <hi>Mine Ears haſt thou opened;</hi> as that therefore he who dyed at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was not Chriſt, but a prepared Body; and that the <hi>Jews</hi> did not ſee Chriſt, but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Body; and that the outward Perſon born of the Virgin was no part of Chriſt, but only a Garment (ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 38, 48.) And to ſtrengthen this Anti-ſcriptural Doctrine, <hi>T. Elwood</hi> has one knack in his <hi>Truth Deſended,</hi> p. 138. where he ventures to belye the common Creed; <hi>The common Creed</hi> (ſays he) <hi>called the Apoſtles Creed, ſays, Chriſt was conceived by the holy Ghoſt, Though born of the Virgin.</hi> Now pray ſearch the common Creed, and ſee if the word <hi>[Though]</hi> be there to be found. Behold this great <hi>Quakers</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion! O what an Impoſture would he have rendered <hi>George Keith</hi> to the World, had he wrote this Lye of the Creed.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Obſerve here how this wiſe Man confounds himſelf: The Scriptures, by his account, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Uncertain, and ſuſpicious (at leaſt) of being corrupted; and yet there is an agreement and union between the Scriptures, as recorded without, &amp; the Spirit within. How does he here
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63933:43"/>
render the Spirit Uncertain! One may ſee by this, that a man who writes much had need have a good Memory, or a ſtable Faith.</p>
               <p>Again, ſomething like this is that late Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of G. W. in his <hi>Counter, Convert,</hi> p 26. <hi>We prefer the holy Scriptures</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before all the Books extant in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, obſerve here how G. W. carries a double face to deceive his Reader; for he does not ſay, that he prefers the Book called the Bible, before all Books extant; no, for then he would contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their Old Books; for the Scriptures in the Bible they eſteem Uncertain (as above) And their former Doctrine ſhews plainly what thoſe holy Scriptures be, which they prefer; for in <hi>Truths Defence,</hi> p. 2. 104. they ſay, <hi>You might as well have condemned the Scriptures to the fire, as our Papers and Querys—for our giving forth Papers or printed Books it is from the immediate and eternal Spirit of God.</hi> Hence it appears, that thoſe holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which they prefer, are their own Books, and ſo much or ſuch parts of the Bible as they will allow to remain uncorrupted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus this inſincere <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> hides himſelf, by a deceivible meaning, as is more plain by what he ſays in his antient Book, called, <hi>Truth defending,</hi> p 7. <hi>That which is ſpoken from the Spirit of Truth in any</hi> (ſays G. W.) <hi>is of as great Authority as the Scriptures and Chapters are, and</hi> GREATER, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Now, is it not evident from hence, that if <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> had expreſt himſelf in the antient ſimplicity of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> he ſhould have worded it thus, <hi>viz. Magiſtracy and Government we own to be Gods Ordinance, ſo far as we</hi> (or Chriſt in us) <hi>have the Command of it, becauſe we know no People elſe, that ſo own and witneſs Chriſt to Rule.</hi> So that when ſuch men rule, 'tis no more them that Rule, but Jeſus Chriſt alone (as above G. F. intimates) the preſent Government being but a dead loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Form. As <hi>T. Ellwood (Sam Jenings</hi> intimate Brother) ſays, in his <hi>Alarm,</hi> p. 6. <hi>Did you not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>make a ſolemn Covenant with God, That you would Extirpate</hi> Epiſcopacy, <hi>that Dead Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Form?

               <p>Now had not the Wheel been ſo turned about, that S.

               <p>In the Year 1695. <hi>A. Smith, W. Budd</hi> and <hi>W. Atkinſon</hi> in <hi>West Jarſey,</hi> for conſtientiouſly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſerve on Jurys, were fined by the Court, for which a Gun was taken from <hi>A.S.</hi> and a ſlitch

of Bacon from <hi>W. B.</hi> But by the Sheriffs pleading for <hi>VV. A.</hi> being poor, he got his Fine remitted. [<hi>Note,</hi> This Sheriff is a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and he deemed the Office of Sheriff, and refuſed to ſerve, rather than ſo to take away his Neighbours goods for matter of Conſcience; but theſe Seperates have not met with ſo much Chriſtianity in any of their old Friends, that have been ſo concerned in Office. Pray let your <hi>London</hi> Meeting take Notice of that, and order thoſe Miniſters that come from you to viſit them, to do what they can to recommend the Virtue of Love to your Brethren here; for all that have hitherto come, has ſet them ſtill more in Oppoſition againſt the Seperates, and have increaſed Envy inſtead of Love; and are ſo far from counting the Seperates to be any of the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom Chriſts Miniſters ſhould ſeek after, that they call them <hi>Amaleck,</hi> &amp; exhort one another to ſmite <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and yet like Cowards, never come at them; or like Cocks crowing on their own Dunghills, they do it only in their own Meeting-houſes among their own Friends; and he that's moſt ingenuous at comparing <hi>G.

               <p>Now here take Notice, The <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> uſed to plead with the Rulers, againſt the Kings Laws, for Liberty of Conſcience.

Beſides, was it likely that the Light or Law in the beſt <hi>Gentiles</hi> would forbid all Swearing at the ſame time when the Law (outward) was in force, that allowed and commanded Swearing? or that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had a light beyond the Prophets, who never did forbid ſuch Swearing, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary commanded it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4 2.</p>
               <p>Another Inſtance W P brings, is, That <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid, <hi>There is a Life more f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And does not W. P. alſo confound himſelf in accuſing <hi>T. Hicks</hi> of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? for if we ask him, who they be that live an unqueſtionable Life? he ſhews us that the Saints

do not; for in <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> p 175 he ſays, <hi>The Saints ſhall judge the World, and much more by their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment determine or reconcile things among themſelves.</hi> Thus ſeeing the Saints live not a life unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but that they need to have things judged and reconciled, how much leſs do others?</p>

Again, If Life may be felt by thoſe who are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Doctrine, and that be enough, why do they adviſe in their Book, called, <hi>An awakening Voice,</hi> p. 15. viz. <hi>People open your Eyes, and be not ſo befooled with that dotiſh and blockiſh Principle, That Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion, but ſearch the Scriptures, and try all things—Have not the most knowing Men in the World been always the most devout to God?</hi>

               <p>IN <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> p. 191. <hi>W.

And purſuent to this Doctrine, ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> formerly have opened their Shops and followed their uſual Imployments on the <hi>Firſt Day,</hi> both in old <hi>England</hi> and elſe-where.</p>
               <p>But behold how the Wheel is now turned! for the <hi>Quakers</hi> at <hi>Delaware</hi> being the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of the Aſſemblies, have lately made a Law to prefer the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> before others, calling it <hi>The Lords Day;</hi> ſo far are they now turned from their former Goſpel, Nay, and this Law has been put in execution too in <hi>Weſt-Jerſey,</hi> and that by none others but <hi>Quakers,</hi> cauſing ſeveral Perſons to ſuffer, one tryed at Court [but cleared by the Jury] after he had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, for doing no more on the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> than thoſe who proſecuted him have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

guilty of, <hi>viz.</hi> taking up a fettered Horſe, or Mare that had ſtrayed from him, that was in danger of being ſpoyled, he having been ſeeking the ſaid Horſe ſeveral days before 'Tis true the man was no <hi>Quaker,</hi> that thus ſuffered for taking this pity and honeſt care on his Beaſt and himſelf; But what then? muſt they needs ſhew to the world, that partiality, &amp;c is inherent to their beſt ſort of Apoſtacy? But if they now ſee the evil of their old Teſtimony of forbidding to prefer the <hi>Firſt day</hi> before another, why do they carry a double face, and not condemn it? O but that's the way to ſhew themſelves fallible, and ſo confeſs themſelves on even ground with other <hi>Chriſtians!</hi> here lies the pinch.</p>
               <p>And G W. is upon the ſame double ſtrein on; for when T. S. asked. <hi>Whether that</hi> Quaker <hi>did not ſin who ſowed a Doubles on the Sabbath day!</hi> G. W. in <hi>Truth defend.</hi> &amp;c. p 21. Replys, <hi>Where doſt thou read in the Scriptures, that men must do no Work on the Firſt Day of the week?</hi> And yet the ſame G. W. in his Tryal at <hi>Norwich,</hi> when the Oath was tendered to him on the Firſt day, he excepted againſt it, becauſe it was tendered on the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> as he calls the firſt day, in p. 26. of the Book of his Tryal; But G. W. might have ſeen in his Brother <hi>S. Fiſher's Ruſticos,</hi> that what is ſawce for the Gooſe is ſawce for the Gander alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:63933:68"/>Here ſeveral other things come before me, of the degeneration of my old Friends, both in Faith and Practice, which for a reaſon beſt known to my ſelf, I at preſent forbear to expoſe; for I know they think I have already done too much; and I hartily wiſh I may never do more of this kind, but that I may be imployed hereafter in what is more delightful to me, but be it as God Almighty ſhall direct me; for methinks I already hear the bitter Treatment I muſt have from my Neighbours, my old Friends round about, far and near And how the Preachers thunder out Woes and Judgments againſt me. But this! the leſs value ſeeing tis an advantage the Preachers have had in all Ages above other men, to preach their pleaſure againſt thoſe who offend them, and that without controul. Hark alſo how they caution and warn their Hearers, not to read ſuch Books as this, whileſt with their other Tongue they bid them, Try all things.</p>

            <p>Again, on the other hand, tho' the <hi>Quakers</hi> one while teach, <hi>That all Figures were ended by Chriſt,</hi> yet G.

But here let G W. turn back to another of his own Books call'd, <hi>The Divinity of Christ,</hi> and Read theſe words in Epiſtle (about figurative Speeches) <hi>viz. We charge thee</hi> [Prieſt <hi>Danſon] ſhew us a Verſe in Scripture, that ſpeaks ſuch Language, and where one word may be put for another by Metalepſes, and ſo leave People in doubts and Queſtions.</hi>

F. <hi>p.</hi> 145.]</p>
            <p>But if on the contrary, they intend the ſaid Titles given to the Scriptures, to be figurative; And if G. W. be Sincere in pretending to prefer the Scriptures above their Books, then ſurely their Books ſhould have had the worſer Titles, and the Scriptures the better Title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good Reader</hi> weigh this point well; for if theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> do not really and indeed prefer their own Books above the Bible, why can they not call the Scriptures, <hi>The Word of the Lord, or Word of God,</hi> in a figurative ſenſe, as well as call their own Books ſo in a figurative ſenſe?</p>
            <p>Therefore I am bold to affirm it, as my real

before cited. Great is their Confuſion throughout their Books, eſpecially about <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and G.

            </p>
            <p>And G.

            <p>Again, G W. in anſwer to <hi>R.

            <p>Now I ſay, ſeeing you have hitherto juſtified this as Goſpel, and Chriſtian Doctrine in thoſe who publiſht it, why do you not continue to preach it, as they did, ſeeing alſo 'tis the Faith or Belief of all you Preachers in general, That when you preach or, pray, 'tis not you, but Chriſt in you that prays. I prove this to be your Belief by theſe two Reaſons,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> You do never in your Meetings pray
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63933:77"/>
for Pardon or Forgiven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of Sin (Not that I have heard in Twenty years due attendance) for ſeeing 'tis Chriſt in you that prays, there is no need of it, he being without ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You do not pray to Chriſt, becauſe it being Chriſt in you that prays, it is abſurd for Chriſt to pray to himſelf.</p>
            <p>But I'll take leave to tell you, <hi>(and prove it too, if need be)</hi> That you are of a different Faith in theſe two things from the Apoſtles, Saints and Martyrs, yea, your Faith or Principle herein is contrary to all the primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in general; for the Scripture, Church Hiſtory and Book of Martyrs ſhew, that then Religion led them to pray publickly for Pardon for their Sins, and ſome even at the point of Death; and alſo both Apoſtles and other Chriſtians frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayed to Jeſus Chriſt, as well as to God the Father.</p>
            <p>Indeed your Preſumption in this Anti-chriſtian Principle is to be lamented, for when ſome of your Fellow Miniſters have been guilty of <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Adulteries, &amp;c.</hi> though not then openly known, yet theſe men, thus ſecretly guilty, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtoop, no more than you, to pray for Pardon for their Sins, but ſtill keep to their common Form in Prayer; and this is a Truth known to more than your ſelves. Now I ask you, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do you Believe 'tis Chriſt that prays in theſe men too, as well as in you, who may not ſo be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63933:78"/>
guilty? Pray anſwer in Truth and Sincerity to this and the reſt of the particulars, or other ways <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now I ſincerely profeſs, that I have done nothing herein but with an honeſt deſign, not having wilfully or knowingly wronged either Books or Authors, in any one paſſage; Therefore I propoſe this to you Preachers, who publickly accuſe us (that have lately printed) calling us, <hi>Apoſtates, Lyars,</hi> and that we have both abuſed you and your Friends Books (in falſly citing Paſſages out of the ſame, and wronging their ſenſe, and the like) to come forth to prove theſe Charges in the face of the world, and if it be found that we have indeed therein wronged you (Errors of the Preſs and other cauſual Miſtakes excepted, which are incident to all) you ſhall (in juſtice and equity) have publick Satisfaction.

And yet, as thou haſt noted, they are Hypocritical in the practice of moſt of thoſe things too, as might alſo be inſtanced in divers other things; I will name two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They make it matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience not to ſing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, and yet they uſe another way of ſinging in their Meetings, and make a great noiſe with it too, eſpecially when any fluent or thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Preacher comes amongſt them; yea, many of them have written in Poſie or Rhymes, which is to he ſung: and as I remember <hi>W. Baily</hi> and <hi>J Coal</hi> call ſome Rhimes that they have written by the Name of <hi>Songs,</hi> ſo that it ſeems People may ſing the <hi>Quakers</hi> Writings, but not <hi>David's,</hi> by their allowance.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, They pretend Conſcience not to Honour or Reſpect their Superiours, by putting off the Hat, but they will bow the Body and pray what's the difference? I take bowing the Body to be a greater

Reſpect than doffing the Hat. But though they cannot doff the Hat to others, yet thoſe <hi>Quakers</hi> who are wealthy that live in great Towns and Cities in <hi>England,</hi> lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Again, as to <hi>Fighting,</hi> thou has well noted their Hypocriſie and wheeling and turning about both in their Writings, and alſo in their Actions about <hi>Delaware</hi> River. But I wonder how thou came to neglect that notable Inſtance of my old Friend and Acquaintance <hi>Walter Clark,</hi> an ancient Preacher, now Governour of <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> who has given ſeveral Commiſſions to Maſters of Veſſels and Privateers to ſight the <hi>French, &amp;c.</hi> to defend which and his Commiſſionating the Officers of the Train-bands under his Government, (and ſometimes heading the ſaid Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands himſelf on his lofty prancing Horſe, and Souldier-like, cauſed the Inhabitants to ſign the Aſſociation on the head of the Drum) brings this Scripture for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,

            <p>Thus by little and little, Inch by Inch they come round and can do that which at another time is againſt their tender Conſciences; yet I queſtion whether ever they'll be able to wreſtle down the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Governours with only little Guns, till they get great ones; as ſome of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
